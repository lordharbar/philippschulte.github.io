        <p>
          I will be your instructor. I’m a self-taught web designer and developer with a great passion for building new things from scratch. I live in the charming city of Lisbon where I create beautiful websites, just like the one you’re about to build in this course. I love everything about tech, riding my bike, and the beach in the summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          By publishing this course, I mix my two great passions: building beautiful websites and teaching. If I had to describe this course in one sentence, I would say “This is exactly the course I wish I had when I first started with web design and development”. I want to spare you the hassle of going through uncountable books and articles, so I packed everything I learned about building websites right into this video course.
        </p>

However, if you don't find value in the course for any reason, I will give you a full refund of your money during 30 days. So now I hope you are as excited as I am to finally start this journey. I will be there to answer all the questions you might have along the way. So start learning today!

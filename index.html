        <h2>Me, Myself, and I</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer with 2 years of experience in developing scalable, maintainable, and secure Web applications. I love to build single-page applications, breaking and fixing code, creating REST APIs and writing unit tests right from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of full-time work I love to teach the fundamentals of web development. I used to be an instructor at DevMountain, a full-stack Javascript bootcamp located in Salt Lake City, UT. Currently I am an instructor at Codify Academy, a front-end bootcamp in San Francisco, CA.
        </p>
        <p>
          I particularly enjoy learning about new JavaScript standards/libraries/frameworks and currently experiment with Elixir and Phoenix. In my free time I experiment with microcontrollers to build my own robots and drones. My specialties are: JavaScript, Elixir, Node, React, Redux, Express, Phoenix, MongoDB, Postgres.

            Simply started, I know how to program because of Philipp. I came into my studies with little more than passion and a vague understanding of the web. Philipp turned my desire to learn into published full stack applications and a new lease on my career. My current position as a product manager with Goldman Sachs has been elevated because of the skills and knowledge Philipp was able to pass on. One of the amazing things about Philipp was the level of effort he put into the curriculum. His enhanced effort expanded the boundaries of our learning and more importantly, he taught me how to think like a developer. When he was in the classroom leading us, we were not only expertly taught the daily objectives, but we were given professional insights that can only be gleaned from someone as detail oriented, smart, experienced, and passionate as Philipp.

            Philipp has a passion for clean, professional code only matched by his passion for teaching others how to code. He is meticulous about his code and is always looking for ways to improve it. Not only is he meticulous about his code, but Philipp is extremely dedicated to his students and spends hours upon hours preparing lectures. He went above and beyond his duties as an instructor at DevMountain. His lectures are why I know how to code.

          <h3>Node &mdash; Server</h3>
          <p>
            I use Node with all supported ES6 and beyound features to build full-stack web and command-line applications. MongoDB is my preferred database, able to power anything from my growing personal project to an enterprise infrastructure.

          <p>
            I have worked with many JS frameworks and libraries. I love to build components to break down the complexity of my applications. Vue.js is definitely my most favorite one because it combines the best of React and Angular 2.0.
